# BASE64GUA

This project features an implementation of base64-like encoding and decoding, using symbols from the 64 hexagrams in place of traditional base64 characters, and using the `â˜¯` to replace `=`.

## Key Files
- `html/base64any.html`: An HTML file that demonstrates the custom base64-like encoding in a web context.
- `python/gua64.py`: The Python script that implements the custom base64-like encoding and decoding. 

## Notes
- This project is designed for fun, showcasing a modified version of base64 encoding.
- Please review the code and documentation within the files for detailed usage and implementation details.

## TODO
- [ ] Create a base64 factory that generates any customized base64 encoding.
- [ ] Add support for image input in the HTML example.
